# Group Survey Generator

This project will generate a Google Form based on a set of questions stored in
a JSON file.  It's original intent is for generating an anonyous [survey for
use within a research group](https://twitter.com/katyhuff/status/988892053353435136).

Usage:

1. Modify the questions in `questions.json` to your liking
1. Copy `GenerateGroupSurvey.js` into a Google Apps Script code
1. Run the script in the Google Apps Script interface
1. Use form

(Probably need more documentation on question types.)
